# Me as Badly Coded website

## 🌌 Homepage
Loads perfectly… until you dive into my code. Then: `Error 503: Developer Brain Not Found`. Still working on the bug fix.

## 🔍 About Me

I’m aspiring developer who loves creating systems that work (most of the time) and constantly improving them.  
Skills include:  
- Building backend systems with **Node.js** that **get the job done**.
- Overthinking code and refining solutions (sometimes making them more complex than necessary, but hey, it’s a learning process!).


## 🛠 Skills

- **Languages**: Python, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, Java  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Bootstrap, Express.js, Django  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Postman, npm

## 🛒 Shopping Cart
Full of ambitious projects, dreams and a few forgotten to-dos.  
**Total Items Purchased**: 0  
**Checkout Button**: “Temporarily Unavailable” 

## 🎨 UI Design
Dark mode always (because I’m a coder who loves clean aesthetics).
