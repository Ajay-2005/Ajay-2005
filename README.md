# Me as Badly Coded website

## 🌌 Homepage

I'm always learning and building. The site's up and running—and the code's a work in progress, just like me.

## 🔍 About Me

I’m aspiring developer who loves creating systems that work (most of the time) and constantly improving them.  
Skills include:  
- Building backend systems with **Node.js** that **get the job done**.
- Overthinking code and refining solutions (sometimes making them more complex than necessary, but hey, it’s a learning process!).
